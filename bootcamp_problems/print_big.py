PRINT BIG: Write a function that takes in a single letter, and returns a 5x5 representation of that letter

print_big('a')

out:   *  
      * *
     *****
     *   *
     *   *

HINT: Consider making a dictionary of possible patterns, and mapping the alphabet to specific 5-line combinations of patterns.
For purposes of this exercise, it's ok if your dictionary stops at "E".
